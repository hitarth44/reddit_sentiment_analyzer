# Stock & Reddit Sentiment Analyzer

This project analyzes Reddit discussions about stocks, identifies the most mentioned tickers, and measures the sentiment toward them.  
The included training script uses **VADER sentiment scoring** to label comments, and then trains a **TF-IDF + Logistic Regression** model to predict sentiment.
