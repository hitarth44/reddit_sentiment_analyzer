## Reddit Stock Sentiment Analyzer â€” Built a sentiment classification pipeline for Reddit stock discussions using Python, scikit-learn, TF-IDF vectorization, and VADER sentiment analysis. Implemented balanced Logistic Regression for imbalanced datasets, achieved ~68% accuracy. Deployed model to predict sentiment from new user input. Used Git for version control and hosted project on GitHub.

## âœ¨ Features

- Reads pre-cleaned Reddit comment data from CSV.
  - Uses **VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer** to assign labels:
  - `positive` if compound â‰¥ 0.05
  - `negative` if compound â‰¤ -0.05
  - `neutral` otherwise
- Trains a TF-IDF + Logistic Regression pipeline.
- Uses `class_weight='balanced'` to handle class imbalance.
- Saves the trained model for future predictions.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

### 1. Prepare Your Data

Place your cleaned comments CSV in the `data/` folder.  
The file **must** contain a `clean_body` column with preprocessed text.

---

### 2. Train the Model

```bash
python train_model.py
```

---

### 3. Explore the Data

The `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` notebook:

- Shows dataset preview & structure.
- Visualizes sentiment class distribution.
- Plots sentiment trends over time.
- Generates word clouds for each sentiment.

Run it:

```bash
jupyter notebook sentiment_analysis.ipynb
```

---

### 4. Predict with the Trained Model

```python
import joblib

model = joblib.load("models/sentiment_model.joblib")
pred = model.predict(["This stock is going to the moon!"])
print(pred)  # Example: ['positive']
```
